            <h4>Art</h4>
            <p>I have always had a passion for art all my life, but I always struggled with realism. When I started taking art classes sophomore year, I challenged myself to create more realistic pieces and ended up loving the style. This piece was my first time painting a portrait; it is also quite large at 18” x 12”. My assignment was to create a piece related to music so I chose my favorite artist, Adele. This piece took me several days to complete but I persevered to create my personal favorite piece.</p>

            <h4>SkillsUSA</h4>
            <p>Junior year I joined an organization called SkillsUSA. SkillsUSA helps high school students who are interested in the trades compete and grow their skills and knowledge. Last year, I competed for web design in our regional and state competitions and quiz bowl in our state and national competition. Despite us competing, there is a sense of community with every member. We share ideas and new concepts with each other because we want each of us to become better. It has helped me become a leader, taking initiative, and helping others. This is a picture of our quiz bowl team before we competed in the state championship, I am the second one from the left. This year I am the BCATC SkillsUSA Reporter and plan on competing in both web design and quiz bowl again. </p>

            <h4>Church Worship Team</h4>
            <p>I am a part of my church’s worship team. I’ve played piano for about ten years of my life and have been playing for my church, Highland Hills Community Church, for about three years. It has not only helped me grow my musical skills but also my communication skills. We are constantly asking the others questions and helping wherever we can.  When I first started, I was extremely nervous but the others helped me build my confidence in my skill. As we start our youth worship band, I want to be that  figure for them.

            <h4>Web Design</h4>
            <p>I have taken many of the computer programming classes offered. Not only have I learned many different programming languages, such as Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, but the classes have also allowed me to grow my collaboration skills. When I was looking for an idea for our final project in our JavaScript class, they told me to make something related to SkillsUSA, a local club, since our state competition was right around the corner. So they helped me create a website to help our quiz bowl team, which I am a part of, study by giving them flashcards with a timer for each question. An example of one of these flashcards is pictured above.</p>
