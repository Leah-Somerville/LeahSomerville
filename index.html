            <p>Growing up I was always taking things apart and putting them back together whether it was pens or Legos. I also discovered my love for art and creativity. In fifth grade, my grandpa introduced me to the field of engineering, a place where I could combine my love for understanding how things work and my creativity. Since then I have taken as many art and technology classes to learn as much as I can about computer engineering before I graduate. I plan to attend the University of Kentucky for Pre-Computer Science Engineering in the fall of 2024. </p>
